# Building Capacity for Curriculum Change: A Strategic Implementation Approach

Implementing new curriculum tools is never just about technology, it’s about people. When our school adopted a new math lab software, the goal wasn’t to replace teachers but to empower them. Success depended on how well we prepared educators, students, and families to embrace it as a meaningful part of learning.

A planned implementation process ensures that change is sustainable. Using Kotter’s model, we began by creating urgency through data that highlighted math performance gaps. Next, we built a coalition of teacher leaders to pilot the software and act as peer mentors. Structured professional learning and coaching cycles helped teachers integrate the tool into daily instruction, while family math nights built community trust and transparency.

This approach turned the software launch into a shared journey rather than a top-down directive. Teachers felt ownership, families saw progress, and leadership gained actionable feedback to refine support systems.

The biggest lesson? Change succeeds when people feel seen in the process. When schools invest in capacity building — not just technology — new tools become catalysts for growth, not compliance.
