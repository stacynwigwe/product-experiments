🔙 **Return to [Main Data Projects Hub](https://stacynwigwe.github.io/portfolio/projects/)**

Welcome to my collection of **real-world product experiments**, where systems thinking meets storytelling.

Each project here began as a simple question: *“How can structure, creativity, and data come together to make people’s lives easier?”*  

This repository showcases my independent work exploring education, technology, and human behavior through the lens of **product strategy, design thinking,** and **operational clarity.**

##  My Approach

Across all projects, I approach problem solving as both an **analyst** and a **builder**:
1. Identify the user pain point  
2. Gather and analyze data  
3. Design a structured solution  
4. Measure, refine, and document  

I believe every great product, digital, physical, or educational, starts with empathy and ends with clarity.
