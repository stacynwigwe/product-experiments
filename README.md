Welcome to my collection of **real-world product experiments**, where systems thinking meets storytelling.  
Each project here began as a simple question: *“How can structure, creativity, and data come together to make people’s lives easier?”*  

This repository showcases my independent work exploring education, technology, and human behavior through the lens of **product strategy, design thinking,** and **operational clarity.**

### 🧠 [CLASS SQL Framework](./class-sql-framework)
A 5-step system I developed to make SQL querying and data interpretation more explainable for educators and analysts.  

This framework bridges the gap between business questions and database logic, helping teams move from **question → data → insight** with clarity and purpose.

- **Focus:** Data storytelling, SQL logic, explainability  
- **Outcome:** Reproducible framework for query planning and instructional use  
- **Method:**  
  - **C — Clarify** the question: Define the who, what, when, and why before coding  
  - **L — Locate** the data: Identify which tables and fields contain the needed information  
  - **A — Apply** filters: Narrow the scope to the relevant records (e.g., subject, date range, thresholds)  
  - **S — Select** the calculation: Choose the right metric (count, avg, %, rank, trend)  
  - **S — Show** the results: Present insights clearly with appropriate columns, order, and format  
- **Tools:** SQL, Power BI, Canva (for visual documentation)  

💡 *From question to answer—fast, accurate, explainable.*

## 💡 My Approach

Across all projects, I approach problem solving as both an **analyst** and a **builder**:
1. Identify the user pain point  
2. Gather and analyze data  
3. Design a structured solution  
4. Measure, refine, and document  

I believe every great product, digital, physical, or educational, starts with empathy and ends with clarity.
