## Overview  
**Class2Career** is a digital transition toolkit that helps educators pivot from the classroom into technology careers with confidence and clarity.  
Built from my own experience transitioning from teacher → consultant → mentor → IT Business Analyst, this project guides users through a structured, reflective journey that connects their *teaching expertise* to *tech industry opportunities.*

**Summary:**  
A 3-phase roadmap designed to help teachers pivot into tech by applying product-thinking and systems strategy to their career transitions.  

**Framework Overview:**  
1️ **Reflect** — Identify strengths and pinpoint transferable skills from classroom experience.  

2️ **Reframe** — Translate teaching language into the technical and analytical language of the tech industry.  

3️ **Reposition** — Build a professional portfolio and confidently launch a new career path in tech.  

*The future of education is evolving, and so can your career.*

## Problem  
Many teachers want to move into tech but don’t know how to begin.  
They face three common roadblocks:  
- Uncertainty translating classroom experience into tech-aligned skills  
- Overwhelm from generic advice not tailored to educators  
- Lack of a structured plan or roadmap for measurable progress  

**Class2Career** addresses this gap with a system designed *by an educator who’s done it*.

---

## Mission  
Empower teachers to transform their transferable skills into a sustainable tech career: bridging the gap between education and technology through systems thinking, reflection, and intentional career design.  

---

## Solution  
A 3-phase roadmap that mirrors how teachers already think and plan:  

### Phase 1: **Reflect**  
Identify and translate existing skills using a *Skill Translation Matrix.*  
> “Lesson Planning → Sprint Planning”  
> “Student Data → Performance Metrics”  

### Phase 2: **Reframe**  
Bridge educational experience with tech language and roles.  
- Resume and LinkedIn translation templates  
- Learning path recommendations for tech tools (CRM, SQL, BI, Agile)  
- Example: “From Classroom Management to Stakeholder Management”  

### Phase 3: **Reposition**  
Build a tech-ready professional identity.  
- Pivot Portfolio template (turn past projects into case studies)  
- Career/Application Tracker dashboard in Google Sheets  
- 30-60-90 Pivot Plan to measure progress
